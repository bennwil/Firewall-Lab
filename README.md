# Firewall-Lab
Build and Configure a Firewall

## Objective

The Firewall Lab project aimed to build and configure a Firewall to protect a network from unauthorized access and potential threats. In this lab, we set up and configured a firewall on an Ubuntu system using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)

### Skills Learned

- Understanding of how to set up and configure a firewall.
- Allowing and denying traffic through protocols, ports, or IP addresses.
- Setting default policies for incoming and outgoing traffic.

### Tools Used

- UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on an Ubuntu system.

## Steps

Step 1: First I ensure my system is up to date, by using the apt update and the apt upgrade command. 


Step 2: Then install UFW.

Step 3: Enable UFW.

Step 4: I can now configure the UFW; for example, I can allow or deny SSH connections.
        Allow or deny HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
        Allow or deny specific ports or a range of ports.
        Allow or deny specific IP addresses.
        Allow or deny specific subnets.
        
Step 5: View UFW status and rules.

Step 6: Set the default policy to allow or deny.

Step 7: View the application policy list.
