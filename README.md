# Firewall-Lab
Build and Configure a Firewall

## Objective

The Firewall Lab project aimed to build and configure a Firewall to protect a network from unauthorized access and potential threats. In this lab, we set up and configured a firewall on an Ubuntu system using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)

### Skills Learned

- Understanding of how to set up and configure a firewall.
- Allowing and denying traffic through protocols, ports, or IP addresses.
- Setting default policies for incoming and outgoing traffic.

### Tools Used

- UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on an Ubuntu system.

## Steps

Step 1: First, I ensure my system is up to date by using the apt update and the apt upgrade command.
